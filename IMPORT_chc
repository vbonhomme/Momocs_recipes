# a chc looks like this:

# we need to drop the first 5 elements and also the last one
# this little helper will take care of that
trim_chc <- function(x){
  # explode on spaces and return a vector
  x2 <- x %>% str_split(" ", simplify=TRUE)
  # trim the first 5 elements and last
  # and return as a numeric for chc2pix() to be happy

# read the raw .chc file
coos <- readLines("YOUR_PATH_HERE")

# extract names from the .chc file
# by grabbing only what's before the first space
# in other words, by removing after the first space (the latter included)
coo_name <- coos %>% str_remove(" .*")

# run this on the coos list
coo <- map(coos, ~.x %>% trim_chc %>% chc2pix)
names(coo) <- coo_name

# build a tibble from these two
coo_df <- tibble(coo_name=coo_name, coo=coo)

# then you can build an Out with eg:
Out(coo_df$coo, df=coo_df %>% select(-coo_name)
